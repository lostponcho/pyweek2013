Underworld Kerfuffle
====================

Created for pyweek 2013


TODO
----

* TEST: Collisions with tile layer

* Store entities in data structure

* Level Generation (Currently basic, just random tiles with a border)
  - Better API for drawing to the map
  
* Entities
  - Separate sprites into collision and drawing sprites (Pygame uses the same Rect for both, which sucks)
  
* AI
  - Currently just a draft of behaviours
  - Need queries of entity lists (i.e. nearest enemy, etc.)
  
* Triggered boss fight (allows for a proper ending)
  - mid way mini boss fight
  - Based on level scripts (i.e. behaviour with a test)
