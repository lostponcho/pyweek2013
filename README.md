Underworld Kerfuffle
====================

Created for pyweek 2013


TODO
----

* Collisions with tile layer (Done, but need to be used / tested)

* Level Generation (Currently basic, just random tiles with a border)
  - Better API for drawing to the map
  
* Store entities in data structure

* Entities
  - Separate sprites into collision and drawing sprites (Pygame uses the same Rect for both, which sucks)
  
* AI
  - Currently just a draft of behaviours
  - Need queries of entity lists (i.e. nearest enemy, etc.)
